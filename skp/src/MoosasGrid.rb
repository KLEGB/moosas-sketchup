    # Generates adaptive grids on selected faces in a SketchUp model based on user-defined parameters.
    # If no faces are selected, prompts the user to select faces. Otherwise, prompts for grid parameters
    # (grid size and offset/reference height) via a dialog box, then creates and returns the generated grid entities.
    # 
    # Parameters:
    # params : Array<Float>, optional
    # An array containing default grid parameters.
    # - params[0] : Float, default 1.0 - Grid cell size.
    # - params[1] : Float, default 0.1 - Offset or reference height for grid placement.
    # - params[2] : Float, default 0.01 - Additional parameter (currently unused in logic).
    # These values may be overridden by user input from the dialog box.
    # 
    # Returns:
    # Array<Sketchup::DrawingElement> or nil
    # Returns an array of successfully created and non-deleted grid entities (edges or other geometry).
    # If no faces are selected, displays an error message and returns nil.
    # If grid creation fails due to invalid parameters (e.g., inappropriate grid size),
    # error messages are shown, but only successfully created entities up to that point are returned.

    # An array of transformation matrices applied to the grid points after projection onto the face planes.

    # A two-element array where:
